# roles.py

# This file contains the names of the roles that you want the bot to be
# able to add/remove for users in your server. Each role will need a constant
# and then be added to the list. (i.e. follow the format)
# In your Discord Server, make sure the role name is matching exactly and that
# the bot role is above the role you want it to manage.
